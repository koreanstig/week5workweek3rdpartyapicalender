# week5workweek3rdpartyapicalender
Using a 3rd party API, I will be creating a calendar/schedule that will display the current day, present time blocks for specific hours, each time block will be color coordinated to show past, present, and future, you can enter an event inside a block, and even if you refresh the page, the data will still be there.
